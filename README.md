# Fulm

In Esperanto, 'fulm' is the root word for 'lightning'. Time-lapse video in Esperanto is 'fulmfilmeto', literally translating to 'lightning video.'

Just like how Esperanto serves as the universal language, Fulm presents itself as a universal solution for a time-lapse screen recorder. Instead of recording hours-long footage only to be condensed into a few minutes, Fulm saves you the pain and time by simply taking screenshots every *x* seconds (you decide) which then combine into a time-lapse video.

[Version v0.1-alpha is out!](https://github.com/leonzalion/Fulm/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha)

**Currently, due to performance issues, the minimum number of delay between screenshots is 1 second. This is an issue I'm fully aware of and keen on fixing. However, if you're planning to time-lapse a long session that you wish to be sped up considerably, Fulm will work well for you :)**
